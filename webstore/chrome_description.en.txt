Hide unwanted streams, games, categories, channels and tags on: twitch.tv

Important Note: This is a best-effort approach to dealing with Twitch's different website views and has always been an arms race. It's not perfect and it will never be. If you expect the extension to always work flawlessly, don't even bother installing it. Know and understand the limits.

Note about breaking changes on twitch.tv
Twitch is infamous for changing their website without further notice, which may break this extension over night. Twitch also serves different canary builds (previews of potential future versions) to selected/random users for up to 4 weeks, which most likely break parts of the extension. If you notice pages no longer working properly, disable the extension, report the issue¹ and wait for an update. Note that updates may take a few days to be approved on the corresponding browser stores.
