<b>Note about breaking changes on twitch.tv</b>
Twitch is infamous for changing their website without further notice, which may break this extension over night. Twitch also serves different canary builds (previews of potential future versions) to selected/random users for up to 4 weeks, which most likely break parts of the extension. If you notice pages no longer working properly, disable the extension, <a href="https://github.com/kwaschny/unwanted-twitch/issues">report the issue</a> and wait for an update. Note that updates may take a few days to be approved on the corresponding browser stores.
